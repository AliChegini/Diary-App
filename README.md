For this project, you will create a Core Data-based Diary App in Swift. You will be responsible for creating the data layer, the UI, as well as all other aspects. You are free to follow the provided mockups or design your own UI, provided the user experience is clear. Given the relatively small feature set for this app, give special attention in creating a good object model and writing clean, extensible code. Be sure to include unit tests, error handling and selecting just the right Swift language “tools” for the job. It might mean a lot of refactoring and getting peer reviews prior to submission. We hope you take the time to create a nice app!

At a minimum, your app should include the following features:


A basic master-detail view architecture

Ability to create text journal entries and display a timestamp for each entry

Ability to edit and delete existing journal entries

Ability to add geolocation data to an entry

Comprehensive unit testing coverage for your code
